## ![hypertally-logo](/public/img/hyper-tally.svg) About Hyper Tally

Hyper Tally is webapp I created to replace my physical scoresheets for games. This is also good practice using software
technologies like Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind. It was also decent graphic design practice creating SVG icons using Gravit
Pro.

Although I host this on my home server as part of Project Neptune I do not currently host a publicly available version.
That being said feel free to use any of this code for your personal use.
